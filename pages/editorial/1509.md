#### First Magazine
PHP Reboot started in April 2014, as a local PHP meetup group in Pune, India. With the first meetup,
we also decided to start a pdf magazine. April 2014 issue was started with many articles written
by Kapil Sharma and also republished (with permission) from blogs of different authors. That magazine
was designed in Libre Office Writer.

Soon we realized it is not an easy task. First we need to write many quality articles, then work
hard to arrange them in Writer and then export pdf. Not an easy task for single person and I could
not find any other developer helping with articles. This is also mixed with official tasks and
time needed for family, first issue soon become last issue, and plan to make good PHP magazines
for developers in Pune was dropped.

#### Reading, reading and reading

I however continue to read other PHP magazines like web and php (now closed), PHP Architect and
obviously lot of quality blogs automatically filling my feedly account. Still to utilize lot of
time (10-15 minutes interval) I generally waste while waiting for meeting, waiting for family
before going out, etc, I started pushing those blogs to my mobile using Pushbullet.

Soon I discovered flip board. In October 2014, magazine started again in form of Flip board
magazines. Important decision, I was not writing any articles for it (except my blog posts)
but collecting blogs of other users.

Flip board went well for 2-3 months but then they changed their design, which did not suited to
my blog collection. This forced me to think if I should be depending on any third party solution?

{% highlight php  startinline=true %}
class Test
{
    private $collection;
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->collection = array();
        $title = "Kapil";
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

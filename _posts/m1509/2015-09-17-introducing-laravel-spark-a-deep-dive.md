On his blog, Matt Stauffer posted a high level overview (tutorial) on Laravel Spark. If you don't know, Laravel Spark, as Taylor introduced at Laracon EU 2015, is to help you make your SAAS applications by taking out pain of few common application tasks like registration, subscription, subscription plans, user profile etc.

> If you've been around on the general Laravel-interested Internet over the last month or two, or if you attended Laracon US or Laracon EU, you've probably already heard of Laravel Spark. If you haven't, check out Taylor's introductory video from Laracon EU.

> I've held off on writing about it until now, because it has changed a lot over the span of its development. It's released as an Alpha now, so the API has solidified some... but it'll still change quite a bit between now and the release.

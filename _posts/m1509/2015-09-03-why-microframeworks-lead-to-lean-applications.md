Matthew Setter, on his blog, posted his thoughts about why micro-frameworks helps you make lean applications.

> Recently I built a new application using SlimPHP, a PHP microframework, instead of a full-stack framework, such as Symfony or Zend Framework 2. In this post, I start discussing how taking this approach has lead to a leaner application design.

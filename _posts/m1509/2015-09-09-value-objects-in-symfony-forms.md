Bernhard Schussek, on his blog, posted a tutorial on making value objects in Symfony forms.

> Many times, Symfony developers wonder how to make a form work with value objects. For example, think of a Money object with two fields $amount and $currency
>
> Can you write a form type for this class without adding the methods setAmount() and setCurrency()? In this post, I will show you how.

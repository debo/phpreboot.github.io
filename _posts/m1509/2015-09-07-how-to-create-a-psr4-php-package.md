On culttt.com, Philip Brown describes how to create a PSR-4 PHP package.

> Over the last couple of weeks I’ve wrote tutorials on many different aspects of the PHP programming language as building blocks for building your own packages. Understanding these different concepts will take you a long way when it comes to creating your own packages for your projects as well as for the Open Source community.
>
> A couple of weeks ago I wrote a tutorial on the general principles behind building PHP packages. In that article I mentioned the PSR-4 standard for creating PHP packages.
>
> In this tutorial I’m going to walk you through setting up the structure of a PHP package. By having an agreed upon structure for PHP packages we make our code a lot more interchangeable and reusable for the greater Open Source community.

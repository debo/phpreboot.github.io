On Sitepoint, Daniel Sipos posted his second article on Drupal 8. This time he is explaining third party settings and pseudo-fields in details.

> In the first installment of this series we started our journey towards creating some simple but powerful functionality. The goal we set was to have the possibility to load a form on each node page and to be able to choose which form type should be used on the different node bundles.
>
> The first step is done. We created a custom plugin type called ReusableForm already featured with a base plugin class that new plugins can extend. Additionally, we saw that each plugin will interact with a form class that is defined in their annotation. And like with the plugins, we also created a base class new forms can extend.

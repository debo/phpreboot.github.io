On sitepoint, Bruno Skvorc given a nice tutorial about creating multi language 'ReadTheDocs' friendly docs with Sitepoint's RTDSphinx-PHP library.

> This post will guide you through getting up and running with RTDSphinx-PHP, a ReadTheDocs-friendly Sphinx based PHP documentation skeleton with sane defaults, pre-installed directives, and modified styles for optimal API and prose documentation rendering in multiple languages. For an unfinished example of the documentation, see here and switch the language in the bottom left flyout panel.

> If this sounds familiar, it’s because we already went through a manual setup of a similar skeleton in a previous post, but that one had no localization support, too many steps, and wasn’t as reusable as this newly developed one. This guide will not be a “let’s build it from scratch” project, but rather an overview of the features this skeleton project offers out of the box, and an introduction into its usage.

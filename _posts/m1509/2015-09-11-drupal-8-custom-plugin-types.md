On Sitepoint, Daniel Sipos posted a tutorial about 'Drupal 8 custom plugin type'.

> Drupal 8 comes with a great addition to the backend developer toolkit in the form of the plugin system. Completely new, specific to Drupal and evolved from serving only a few specific purposes, plugins have become the go-to system for reusable functionality in Drupal 8.
>
> In this article series of two parts, we will use this system to build a feature that allows the use of custom forms together with node entities. After we’re done, we’ll be able to do the following:
> 
> - configure node bundles to use one of multiple form types to be displayed together with the node display
> - easily define new form types by extending from a sensible base class

On cilttt.com, Philip Brown posted a tutorial about 'Managing context in a Laravel application".

> Context is a very important thing within a web application. The majority of all web applications will be used by multiple users, companies or groups. Context determines how business rules should be enforced.
>
> Managing context can be tricky. You need to set the context authoritatively and then refer to it throughout the application.
>
> However, it’s easy to get yourself into a tangle when a consistent approach is not enforced.
>
> I’ve recently started taking a new approach to setting the context. I’ve found it really easy to set up and reason about. When an application starts to become too big to hold in your head at once, you need systems in place to keep things as simple as possible.

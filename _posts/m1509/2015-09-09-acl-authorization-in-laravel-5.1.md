On his blog, Matt Stauffer posted series of nice tutorials on Laravel 5.1 new features. Latest in series is on ACL Authorization. The whole series is must read for anyone working on Laravel 5.1

The series contains 11 articles as of 9th September 2015.

> The authentication that Laravel provides out-of-the-box makes it simple to get user signup, login, logout, and password resets up and running quickly and easily.
>
> But if you needed to control access to certain sections of the site, or turn on or off particular pieces of a page for non-admins, or ensure someone can only edit their own contacts, you needed to bring in a tool like BeatSwitch Lock or hand-roll the functionality, which would be something called ACL: Access Control Lists, or basically the ability to define someone's ability to do and see certain things based on attributes of their user record.
>
> Thankfully, Taylor and Adam Wathan wrote an ACL layer in Laravel 5.1.11 that provides this functionality without any added work.

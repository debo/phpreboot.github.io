On Sitepoint, Craig Bucker posted his second article 'Sql vs NoSQL: How to Choose" after initial articel 'SQL vs NoSQL: The difference".

> In the previous article we discussed the primary differences between SQL and NoSQL databases. In this follow-up, weâ€™ll apply our knowledge to specific scenarios and determine the best option.
>
> SQL databases are ideal for projects where requirements can be determined and robust data integrity is essential. NoSQL databases are ideal for unrelated, indeterminate or evolving data requirements where speed and scalability are more important. In simpler terms:
>
> - **SQL is digital.** It works best for clearly defined, discrete items with exact specifications. Typical use cases are online stores and banking systems.
> - **NoSQL is analog.** It works best for organic data with fluid requirements. Typical use cases are social networks, customer management and web analytics systems.

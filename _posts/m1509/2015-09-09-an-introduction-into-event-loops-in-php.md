On sitepoint, Christopher Pitt introduced about event-loop in php, to achieve asynchronous programming in PHP using Icircle and ReactPHP.

> PHP developers are always waiting for something. Sometimes we’re waiting for requests to remote services. Sometimes we’re waiting for databases to return rows from a complex query. Wouldn’t it be great if we could do other things during all that waiting?

> Icicle is library of components built with the event loop in mind.
>
> ReactPHP has a similar event loop implementation, but without all the interesting generator stuff.

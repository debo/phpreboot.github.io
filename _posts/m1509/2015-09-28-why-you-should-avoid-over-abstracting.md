On MadeWithLove blog, Hannes explained why Over-Abstracting is bad and should be avoided.

> Some time ago I started working on an existing project, so I read the documentation before diving in. At the top of the contributing.md file there was this sentence: “Abstract when possible”. Quickly I learned the project contained more abstract classes than a normal project. This leads to too highly coupled, and often unchangeable code.

> This post is dedicated on explaining why “abstract when possible” isn’t good advice. Not only in PHP, but in all programming languages.

Zumba Tech published a nice blog post where Juan Basso explained how they cached CakePHP routes to get better performance.

> At Zumba we are continuously looking for optimization in our applications. These optimizations help to reduce the server loads, consequently reducing the number of servers and saving money. Besides that, it gives a better user experience for the end user by serving content faster and in some cases saving on consumer bandwidth (specially for mobile users).

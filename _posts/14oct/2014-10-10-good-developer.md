On sitepoint, George Fekete explained how you can be a good developer.

> As a PHP developer, or any kind of developer as a matter of fact, you need to constantly improve yourself in this ever-changing industry; you need to learn and use new knowledge every day.
> <br/><br/>
> What successful developers have in common, is that they care about programming a lot, they are professionals treating good programming practices as a form of art.
> <br/><br/>
> In this article, you’ll learn about how to be a better developer by following the “etiquette” of programming and you’ll learn how to use this information to perhaps teach others to better themselves.

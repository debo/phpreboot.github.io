On his blog, Michelangelo van Dam suggested his idea of hosting for making a product from idea to production instantly.

> I know you had it often: you had this crazy idea and worked out a quick prototype and want to share it with the world. So you start up your personal VMS or a VM in the cloud, push your code there and you're happy, all is working.
> <br/><br/>
> But this prototype, just like all the other prototypes, grows into a heavily used and very important tool and before you know it you're pushing updates a couple of times a day to production. This still sounds familiar?

On Linkedin, Michael Dowling published how to manage change logs of a project using his library `chag`, which creates change logs based on `keepachangelog.com` standards.

> Open source projects often include some kind of changelog file that helps consumers of the project to be aware of any important changes that have been made between versions. The format and filename of a changelog typically varies from project to project; however, there’s some promising news… http://keepachangelog.com hopes to standardize how open source projects represent changelog files. I’ve recently begun modifying the changelog files of all of my projects to conform to this new changelog standard.

> I created chag, short for “changelog tag”, in order to automate the process of extracting changelog information from a project’s changelog file.

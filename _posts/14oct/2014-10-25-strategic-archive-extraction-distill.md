On Sitepoint, Peter Nijssen introduced Distill, a library to work with archives and extract them.

> Perhaps you are building an application which depends on archives; for example, you constantly have to download archives and extract files from them. There are many libraries out there that can help you get files extracted from an archive, and a new player in town capable of doing this job is Distill.
> <br/><br/>
> With Distill, you can easily extract an archive into a specified directory. You can also give multiple archives to Distill and let it pick the most optimal one, as per a strategy you define yourself. Letâ€™s dive into the code to see what we can achieve with Distill.

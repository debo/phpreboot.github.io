On his recent blog, Phil Sturgeon, frustrated of many composer packages, many of which solving same problem, presents his view on when you should release your composer package.

> In the last article I said I wanted to write about when its a good idea to release a component. A lot of this comes down to: is there one out there that does what I want, and if so, can I use it?
> <br/><br/>
> This blog post is going to touch on a lot of points already made well by Anthony Ferrara. His article Reinvent The Wheel! says many of the same things, so if you only have time to read one article right now, go and read that.

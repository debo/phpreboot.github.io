In his latest blog post, Dave Marshall explained how to use Mockery tool. Mockery is helpful to create mock objects while testing.

> Spies have been on the cards for mockery for a long time and even after putting together an implementation in February, I kind of stalled out on making a decision on the public API. Fast forward a few months and I figured it was just time to ship it, so I went with the most mockery like API and merged it in. Mockery still doesn't have a 1.0 release, so I can always make changes before we go 1.0.

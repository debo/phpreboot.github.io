On his blog, Anthony Ferrara described what actually term `agile` mean

> To some of you, this may not be new. But to many of the people preaching "Agile Software Development", Agile is not what you think it is. Let me say that again, because it's important: You're Doing Agile Wrong.
> <br/><br/>
> Some people think that Agile is a project management framework. They are wrong.<br/>
> Some people think that Agile is a development methodology. They are wrong.<br/>
> Some people say that Agile is a "tool". They are wrong.<br/>
> To say it simply, Agile is a philosophy.<br/>
> Or more accurately, Agile is a business philosophy.<br/>

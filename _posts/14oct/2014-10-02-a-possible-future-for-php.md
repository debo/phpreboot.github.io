Frank Karlitschek, lead developer of owncloud, recently blogged on why he choosed php for own cloud and his view about future of php.

> ownCloud is one of the biggest open source project written in PHP if you look into the latest statistics. It is used for the server part of ownCloudas most of you know. We use other technologies like C++ and Qt for the Desktop Clients, Java for the Android app and Objective-C for iOS, JavaScript for the web-interface and more. But the heart of ownCloud is the server component which is using PHP 5.3 or higher..

> PHP is not the most hip programming language in the world. Actually the opposite. It has a relatively bad reputation. I personally was never a big fan of choosing the technologies based on what is cool or “modern” or in vogue. I think there are different technology for different jobs and they should be evaluated objectively and choose without to much emotion involved. So I don´t understand the religious discussions why tool x is always better than technology y. I think it is all about the right technology for the job after a fair assessment of course.

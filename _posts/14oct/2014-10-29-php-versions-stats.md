Pascal Martin collected some interesting data about installed PHP versions on different servers and bloged with these statistics.

> I have collected data and written about usage of each PHP versions a few times already — up until now, always in French: this is the first time I’m doing this in English. The first time I’ve done this was in September 2011 and the most recent one was almost one year ago, in November 2013. At that time, PHP 5.2 was still representing 34.4% of PHP installations, with PHP 5.3 ahead with 48.7%.

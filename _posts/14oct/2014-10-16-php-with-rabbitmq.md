Miguel Ibarra Romero, on sitepoint, explained how to setup and use Rabbit MQ with PHP. A must read if you are going to integrate Rabbit MW in your PHP project.

> AMQP (Advanced Message Queueing Protocol) is a network protocol that can deliver messages from one application endpoint to another application endpoint. It does not care about the platform or language of said applications, as long as they support AMQP.
> <br/><br/>
> Essentially, one of the application endpoints sends a message, thus being a Producer, through an AMQP broker. In turn the broker will deliver the message to another application endpoint, called the Consumer.

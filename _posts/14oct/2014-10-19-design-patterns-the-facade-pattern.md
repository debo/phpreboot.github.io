On tutsplus, Avinash Zala posted a series of design patterns. In this first post of the series, he is discussing about `The Facade Pattern`.

> Problem<br/>
> Let's assume that you have a few operations to be made in sequence, and that the same action is required in multiple places within your application. You have to place the same code again and again in different places. You have done that, but after a few days you find that something needs to be changed in that code.
> <br/><br/>
> Do you see the problem? We have to introduce the changes in all of the places that the code exists. It's painful, isn't it?

On his blog, Benjamin Eberlei posted his reasons of using Symfony for web development.

> My Symfony Hello World post introduced the smallest possible example of a Symfony application. Using this in trainings helps the participants understand of just how few parts a Symfony application contains. Sure, there are lots of classes participating under the hood, but I donâ€™t care about the internals only about the public API.

> We use microservice architectures for the bepado and PHP Profiler projects that Qafoo is working on at the monent. For the different components a mix of Symfony Framework, Silex, Symfony Components and our own Rest-Microframework (RMF) are used. This zoo of different solutions sparked a recent discussion with my colleague Manuel about when we would want to use Symfony for a web application.

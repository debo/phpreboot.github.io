In his recent post, Matthias Noback presented his view on composer's `provide` option after Peter Petermann's post on 'Composer and virtual packages'.

> This is a response to Peter Petermann's article Composer and virtual packages. First, let's make this totally clear: I don't want to start an Internet war about this, I'm just pointing out some design issues that may arise from using Composer's provide option in your package's composer.json file. This means it's also nothing personal. To Peter: you wrote a very nice article and shed light on an underused feature of Composer. Thank you for that!

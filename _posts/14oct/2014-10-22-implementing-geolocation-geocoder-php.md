Arno Slatius, on sitepoint.com, describing how to get geolocation information using Geocoder PHP library.

> I love working with maps and geographic information and I use (reverse) geocoding heavily for a project I did for a client; CableTracks. We actually use a paid service for this although not for everything. The paid results hold much more information than you get from free services. I found out that Geocoder PHP actually is what I was missing for the integration of various services that we use.
> <br/><br/>
> Geocoder PHP provides: “an abstraction layer for geocoding manipulations”. The library is split into three parts: an HttpAdapter for doing requests, several geocoding Providers and various Formatter/Dumpers to do output formatting.

Rafael Dohms had a new blog post where he explains the basics of Composer.

> I have been putting together a new talk about Composer, and that means looking around the community, doing loads of research and trying to identify the items that need to be covered in a talk. Mostly I have been trying to identify things that people do on a regular basis that according to composer internals is either wrong or not ideal.

> One such thing that I have found is the proper selection of versions, and that also led me to find a new feature in composer that makes everyoneâ€™s life so much easier. So let me break this down.
